# Five IR Sensors-Based Line Following Bot

## Introduction

This project presents a fully tested code for a line-following robot using five IR sensors. The bot is designed to navigate along a line on a surface, making precise turns and adjustments based on sensor readings. The project aims to provide a robust and efficient solution for line-following robots in various applications.

## Features

- **Precision Navigation:** Accurate line detection and following with five IR sensors.
- **Robust Design:** Handles straight lines, curves, and intersections.
- **Efficient Algorithm:** Optimized for quick response and minimal processing time.
- **Easy Integration:** Modular code compatible with various microcontrollers.
- **Open Source:** Available for anyone to modify and improve.

## Hardware Requirements

- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano)
- Five IR sensors
- Motor driver (e.g., L298N, L293D)
- Two DC motors
- Chassis for the bot
- Battery pack (9V or 12V)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE (version 1.8.0 or higher)
- C/C++ programming language
